# Converting recordings

The `rd convert` command turns a raw recording directory (containing
`.svo2` / `.bag` camera files and `robot_data.npz`) into a
a structured dataset directly consumable by policy-training frameworks.

## Usage

```bash
rd convert
```

Running the command opens an interactive fzf selector. Tasks are listed newest
first. Use Tab to toggle individual tasks, Enter to confirm, or select
`*** ALL TASKS ***` at the top to convert everything at once.

By default `rd convert` reads from `./data/raw/` and writes to `./data/processed/`.
Pass `--data-dir` to use a different root:

```bash
rd convert --data-dir /mnt/storage/robot_data
```

### Episode filtering

`rd convert` only processes **successful** demonstrations — recordings marked as
failure or pending in the metadata database are always skipped.

Additionally, recordings already marked as `converted` in the database are
skipped by default, so re-running `rd convert` after adding new demonstrations
only processes the new ones.  To re-convert everything regardless:

```bash
rd convert --reconvert
```

If a recording has no database entry (e.g. recorded before the DB was set up)
its status is treated as unknown and it is included.

## Multi-camera synchronization

All ZED SVO2 cameras are extracted **simultaneously** in a single pass. On
each output frame slot the converter advances any camera that lags the most
recent camera by more than half a frame period (~16 ms at 30 fps) before
saving. This guarantees that for any output index *N* the images from all
cameras are within 16 ms of each other.

Cameras are also truncated to the **minimum frame count** across all cameras,
so every camera directory contains exactly the same number of frames.

## File formats

**`rgb/<camera>/<frame:010d>.jpg`**
: BGR JPEG at quality ≥ 90. For cameras physically mounted upside-down
  (`right_wrist_camera`) the image is rotated 180° so the stored image is
  always right-side-up.

**`depth/<camera>/<frame:010d>.npz`**
: Compressed NumPy archive with a single key `"depth"` holding a uint16
  array (height × width) in **millimetres**. Zero means no-data.

**`rgb/<camera>/timestamps.npy`**
: `int64` NumPy array of length *N*. Each value is the wall-clock capture
  timestamp of the corresponding frame in nanoseconds (Unix epoch), on the
  same clock as `robot_data.npz` `timestamps`. For ZED cameras this comes
  directly from `sl.TIME_REFERENCE.IMAGE`; for RealSense cameras it is
  derived from the hardware timestamp corrected to wall-clock via the
  clock offset measured at recording start.

**`lowdim/<frame:010d>.pkl`**
: Per-frame lowdim file (one per frame, shared across all cameras). Keys:

| Key | Shape | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `intrinsics` | `dict[str → (3, 3) float32]` | `{camera_name: K}` — pinhole camera matrix `[[fx, 0, cx], [0, fy, cy], [0, 0, 1]]`. Principal point adjusted for upside-down cameras. |
| `extrinsics` | `dict[str → (4, 4) float32]` | `{camera_name: T_cam2world}` in the **left\_arm\_base** frame for this frame. Sim cameras: read from the model and state that rendered the frame. Scene cameras: static calibrated extrinsics. Wrist cameras: computed from forward kinematics + hand-eye calibration. |
| `joints` | `(14,)` float32 | Follower **actual** joint positions at this frame: `[left_arm(6), left_gripper(1), right_arm(6), right_gripper(1)]`. |
| `action` | `(26,)` float32 | FK EE poses computed from **commanded** joint positions (`follower_*_joint_cmd`): `[l_pos(3), l_rot9(9), l_gripper(1), r_pos(3), r_rot9(9), r_gripper(1)]`. Left arm pose is in the **left\_arm\_base** frame; right arm pose is in the **right\_arm\_base** frame. Rotation is the 3×3 matrix flattened row-major. |
| `actual_poses` | `(26,)` float32 | FK EE poses computed from **actual** joint positions (`follower_*_joint_pos_7d`): same layout as `action`. Represents where the arm physically was, not where it was commanded to go. |
| `action_joints` | `(14,)` float32 | Commanded joint positions: `[left_arm(6), left_gripper(1), right_arm(6), right_gripper(1)]`. Same source as `action` but in joint space. |
| `language_task` | str | Task name. |
| `language_prompt` | str | Task instruction. |
| `table_pose` | `(4, 4)` float32 | Table frame (origin at the centre of the table top, axes along the base axes) in the **left\_arm\_base** frame, from `table.T_base_table` in `calibration_results.json`; identity when absent. |
| `sim_state` | `(1 + nq + nv,)` float64 | Sim only. MuJoCo `[time, qpos, qvel]` the frame was rendered from; replay it in the episode's `sim_model.xml` to re-render from any camera. |
| `object_poses` | `dict[str → (4, 4) float32]` | Sim only. Task object poses in the **left\_arm\_base** frame. |
| `subtasks` | `dict[str → bool]` | Sim only. BDDL subtask predicates, in task order. |
| `success` | bool | Sim only. Task goal satisfied. |

The sim keys come from `cameras/<camera>.simrec/sim_state.npz`, which holds the
state each sim frame was rendered from; every frame takes the snapshot nearest
its timestamp, which for the reference camera is its own. Sim episodes also
get `sim_model.xml` next to `lowdim/`.

Sim recordings store no pixels. The converter renders each camera's frames
from its `sim_state.npz` in the episode's `sim_model.xml` (the model's asset
paths must still exist). Without a display, raiden selects `MUJOCO_GL=egl`.

While rendering, each frame's camera pose is read from the state that drew its
pixels and written to `rgb/<camera>/camera_poses.npy`, which then follows the
frames through timestamp selection and trimming. These poses become the sim
`extrinsics`, so a sim frame and its pose label cannot disagree — including for
the wrist camera, whose FK-based label carried the difference between raiden's
i2rt arm model and MESA's (about 4.4 mm at the camera) plus the error from
interpolating telemetry onto the camera grid.

## Coordinate system

The **left-arm base frame** is the global coordinate origin for all poses and
extrinsics. This convention is fixed regardless of whether you are running a
bimanual or single-arm setup - in single-arm mode the sole arm is always
treated as the left arm.

## Wrist camera extrinsics

Sim recordings label their cameras from the model instead (see above); this
section is the path a real recording takes.

Extrinsics for `left_wrist_camera` and `right_wrist_camera` are computed
**per frame** using forward kinematics (FK):

```
T_left_base→cam[i] = [T_left_base←right_base @] FK(q[i]) @ T_cam→ee
```

- `FK(q[i])` - MuJoCo forward kinematics for the YAM arm evaluated at the
  follower joint positions interpolated to frame *i*'s timestamp.
- `T_cam→ee` - hand-eye calibration result (camera-to-end-effector). The
  calibration was performed with the raw (upside-down) camera image, so for
  `right_wrist_camera` a 180° Z-axis rotation correction is folded in.
- `T_left_base←right_base` - applied only for `right_wrist_camera` to
  bring the result from right-arm base into the common left-arm base frame.

## Timestamp-based interpolation

`joints`, `action`, and `actual_poses` are interpolated from the ~100 Hz `robot_data.npz`
onto the camera frame timestamps using `numpy.interp`. Both sources are in
the same unit (int64 wall-clock nanoseconds), so no clock-domain conversion
is needed. A single reference camera timestamp grid is used for all cameras
in the episode (preferring wall-clock timestamps from ZED cameras).
